            Planets form using 3 things. Dust, Gravity and Gas. Dust is a very
            small pieces of dry dirt, sand, etc. in the form of a powder. Gas is
            a a substance like air that is not a solid or a liquid.To understand
            gravity, imagine the space is a huge grid. When we introduce an
            object to it, it bends the grid. That is because, it has mass!! Mass
            is the amount of stuff an object is made from.The more mass the
            object has, the more it bends space! When we place an object with
            less mass nearby,it moves towards objects with more mass!! That's
            gravity!! First there is a cloud of dust and gas. When there is
            enough dust and gas to bend space in the center of the cloud,that
            causes gravity to kick in! And that gravity will make most of the
            particles to form to the center. When that happens, the particles
            get bigger. The collapse causes all of them to smash into each other
            and form clumps! The collisions release energy which causes heat!
            Eventually, the center of the cloud gets so hot, it forms a star!

            After a star is formed, there is still some huge dust and gas
            particles which is left floating around get to become planets!!
            <br />
            As dust clumps move around the star, they smash into each other and
            grow more massive! After some time those clumps form into
            planetisemels. Planetisemels form when there is gravity enoought, to
            make them round! But their just the building blocks of a planet.
            Then they form protoplanets. Their like baby planets! When a bunch
            of protoplanets hit each other, they form a planet!!
